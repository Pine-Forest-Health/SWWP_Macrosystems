## Project overview:
An interdisciplinary, collaborative team led by Northern Arizona University and including Oregon State and 
Virginia Commonwealth Universities, the USDA Forest Service, and international collaborators from Universidad 
Juarez del Estado de Durango, Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico and Institute for Forestry, conducted 
research to understand and predict the distribution, geneflow and adaptive evolution of southwestern white pine 
(*Pinus strobiformis*) and interactions with a pathogen (*Cronartium ribicola*) in the context of rapid climate change. 
The project is unique in evaluating range-wide landscape genomic, quantitative genetic, and epigenetic patterns of variation, 
evaluation of the fitness consequences of observed variation in controlled common garden experiments, direct assessment
of the patterns and genetic basis of pathogen resistance, and spatially explicit simulation modeling to predict the effects 
of climate change and host-pathogen interactions on range shift, patterns of gene flow and potential adaptive evolution 
of southwestern white pine.

By combining range-wide empirical analysis of patterns of genetic and epigenetic variation relative to climatic gradients 
with controlled common garden experiments provided robust tests of genetic variation and its influence on potential species 
distributions. In addition, assessment of the extent and genetic basis of pathogen resistance to white pine blister rust is 
enableing us to model the joint effects of climate change and expansion of an invasive pathogen on the distribution, 
genetic diversity, population connectivity and adaptive evolutionary potential of the southwestern white pine.
